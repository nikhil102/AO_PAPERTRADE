Dear Zyna, Thiago, and Steve,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to address the serious accusations made by Ms. Sasmita Khadanga in her recent email. Firstly, I want to clarify that I have always upheld respect and equality in my professional interactions. If any of my statements were misunderstood as disrespectful, I sincerely apologize.
Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working with many talented and highly skilled women, and I have always maintained a respectful and collaborative approach.

However, I must address the tone and content of Ms. Sasmita's response. Her statements, such as "Whatever I say in this project will be the final decision," and "You are no one to ask me what is my role," were delivered in a commanding and offensive manner, including dismissive hand gestures. Such behavior is unacceptable and not conducive to a professional environment.

Additionally, my logical questions regarding the project were portrayed in an absolutely misleading way by Ms. Sasmita. It is her personal viewpoint that my inquiries were illogical, which she has represented in a very misleading tone. It is important for the significant workforce to have thorough knowledge about the project, be transparent about their roles and responsibilities, and clearly define the structure with points of contact to facilitate daily communication. There is nothing illogical in seeking clarity on these matters. Ms. Sasmita's portrayal of my questions was unfounded and inappropriate.

Our team and I have worked really hard on this project, contributing significantly to its success delivering in GCP to Bifrost. The constant changes in roles and responsibilities with unclear communications from Ms. Sasmita's end have caused confusion and disruption in ongoing process of MP6. Clear communication and transparency are crucial, yet Ms. Sasmita's response lacked both.

My collaboration with our testing team, which consists entirely of female colleagues, has always been professional and respectful, and I encourage you to seek their feedback regarding my work mannerisms.

The false allegations and defamatory remarks in her email are particularly troubling. It appears there is a gender bias at play, which I firmly believe neither LTI Mindtree nor S&P Global would support. I request immediate action to address this issue and ensure a respectful working environment for all.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.


Regards,
Nikhil Shinde
